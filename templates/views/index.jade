			.heroIntroCopy.col-md-8.col-md-offset-2 Blockchain technology is in its infancy and is often not well suited for the needs of industry. Scalability challenges and the lack of support for confidential and private transactions, among other issues, make its use infeasible for many important industry applications. We lay out an industryâ€“focused design, based on and extending the learnings of the pioneers in this field.

				.row
					div.description.col-lg-8.col-lg-offset-2
						p Open source projects depend on a lot more than code to be successful. Accurate documentation, support, meetups, and blogs are also critical to a healthy project. We are using #[a(href="#") Github Flow] process to contribute code.  here is the basic Github Flow:

				.row
					.col-lg-5
						ul
							li Anything in the master branch is deployable
							li To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of your fork.  More detail on fork.
							li Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
							li When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request (make sure successfully built and tested with the testsuite)
							li After your pull request has reviewed and signed off, a committer can merge it into master branch
					.col-lg-5.col-lg-offset-2
						p
							span We use the same approach as the Linux Kernel community, The Developers's Certificate of Origin, to manage contributions.
							span We simply ask that hwen submitting a pull request, that the developer includes a sign-off statement in the pull request's desription.

						p Here is an example Signed-off-by-line.  It indicates that the submitter accepted the DCO:
						pre
							code Signed-off-by: John Doe &#60;john.doh@domain.com&#62;
